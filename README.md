## Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

- **Deliverable:** `Part1_Theoretical_Analysis.pdf`
- Includes answers to:
  - AI-driven code generation
  - Supervised vs. unsupervised learning in bug detection
  - Ethical considerations in AI personalization
  - AIOps case study examples

---

## Part 2: Practical Implementation

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
- **Tools:** GitHub Copilot, Tabnine
- Compare AI-suggested code vs manual implementation for sorting a list of dictionaries
- Deliverables:
  - `copilot_suggestion.py`, `manual_implementation.py`, `comparison.md`
  - Screenshots of execution

### Task 2: Automated Testing
- **Tools:** PyTorch, pytest
- Unit and integration tests for a classification model
- Deliverables:
  - `src/` → model, pipeline, utilities
  - `tests/` → pytest scripts
  - `requirements.txt` and task-specific README
- Run tests with:

```bash
cd part2_practical/task2_automated_testing
python -m pytest -q tests
````

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

* **Tools:** Random Forest, scikit-learn, pandas
* Dataset: Kaggle Breast Cancer
* Predict issue priority and evaluate performance
* Deliverables:

  * `notebook.ipynb` → full workflow
  * `report.md` → evaluation and analysis
  * `models/model.pkl` and `artifacts/metrics.json`

---

## Part 3: Ethical Reflection

* **File:** `part3_ethics/ethical_reflection.md`
* Discusses potential biases in predictive models and fairness mitigation
* References IBM AI Fairness 360 for bias detection and correction

---

## Bonus Innovation Challenge

* **File:** `bonus_innovation/proposal.pdf`
* Proposal for **AI-Assisted Documentation Generator**
* Highlights purpose, workflow, impact, and implementation notes

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd ai-software-engineering-assignment
```

2. Install Python dependencies for Task 2 and Task 3:

```bash
pip install -r part2_practical/task2_automated_testing/requirements.txt
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib matplotlib
```

3. Run notebooks or scripts as needed:

* Task 2: `pytest` tests
* Task 3: Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab

---

## Notes

* Each task folder contains a dedicated README (where applicable) for task-specific instructions
* Screenshots and PDF reports are included to illustrate outputs
* The project is structured to be **modular, reproducible, and easy to navigate**
